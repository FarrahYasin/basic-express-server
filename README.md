#### Notes from demo and my notes: 

1. we always must do testing to our code
2. we run the application from the index.js as the starting point.
3. server.js is will contain all routes we will have
4. we can do some validation to some things like if its a number do something
5. the middleware will do something in the back of the system and they send to us a results that we need it only , so we can't send json or status in the middleware.
6. the response will be in the handler function in the server.js
7. we can send data back to the handler byadd new properity to the object of the object that we have, then we go to the handler to continue, so the request will contain the new properity from the middleware
